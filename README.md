# Uniss-MDF

UNISS-MDF represents the first collection of 2D-3D data of human faces, acquired with a mobile device. Over 80,000 samples of depth, images and videos are captured from a diverse set of 100 subjects, in both controlled and uncontrolled conditions.
It is a versatile resource for researchers and a wide range of applications. Notably, it is the sole 2D-3D facial dataset using data from a mobile device, including both 2D and 3D synchronized sequences acquired in controlled and uncontrolled conditions.
